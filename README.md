# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

A simple shell implementation in C.

## Description

This shell is a basic command-line interpreter that allows users to execute commands and interact with the operating system. It supports features such as command execution, environment variable handling, and basic error handling.

## Features

- Command execution: The shell can execute commands entered by the user.
- Environment variable handling: The shell can access and display environment variables.
- Error handling: The shell provides basic error handling for command execution and input parsing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)


## Usage

1. Launch the shell by running the executable.
2. Enter commands at the prompt and press Enter to execute them.
3. Use built-in commands (e.g., `exit`, `env`) or system commands (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`).
4. To exit the shell, use the `exit` command.

## Examples

```
$ ./shell
#cisfun ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  directory
#cisfun pwd
/home/user/shell
#cisfun exit
$
```
